# FFXIV Screenshot Organiser

Tool for automatically renaming Final Fantasy XIV screenshots into a format that makes more sense for indexing. 

Normally screenshots taken inside FFXIV are stored in a format of:  
`ffxiv_{day}{month}{year}_{hour}{minute}{second}_{random_id}.png`  

This makes them really annoying to sort through when trying to find your latest screenshots or ones from a specific date.

This tool renames all of these files into a better pattern of:  
`ffxiv_{year}-{month}-{day}--{hour}-{minute}-{second}_{random_id}.png`

Now the latest screenshots will always appear at the bottom or top of the folder, with everything grouped together in a more logical way.
